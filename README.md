Hi,

This is a database of SHA256 and SHA512 hashes of Apple firmware updates.
Extracted from Apple firmware updates and OS updates.

There are no official signatures (yet) available from Apple.
This would be a very useful thing for Apple to make available.

I'll keep adding older versions as I'm able to track them.

Later on, I will also make all the files available on this repo.

My PGP key is available here:

Key Fingerprint:
7B05 44D1 A1D5 3078 7F4C  E745 9BB7 2A44 ED41 BF05

Enjoy,
fG!
